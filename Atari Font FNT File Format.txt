FNT file format - fonts from Atari computer.

File extension: FNT.

File is binary.

File has 1024 bytes.
Additional bytes at the end may appear, but their meaning is unknown.

Font contains a table of 128 characters.

Each character is a bitmap of 8 x 8 pixels.

Each pixel is monochromatic - it can be either transparent or translucent.

File contains subsequent characters.

Each character takes 8 bytes.

Each byte is a bitmap row, saved from top to bottom.

Each bit in that byte is a single pixel, saved so that most significant bit is
the leftmost pixel.

Bit 0 means transparent pixel and bit 1 means translucent pixel.

Visualization:

Font can be imagined as a bitmap of 256 x 32 pixels showing array of 32 x 4
characters.

Mapping Atari FNT characters to PC ASCII characters:

- Atari 0x00 ... 0x3F map to ASCII characters 0x20 ... 0x5F
- Atari 0x40 ... 0x5F are special graphical symbols
- Atari 0x60 ... 0x7F map to ASCII characters 0x60 ... 0x7F
